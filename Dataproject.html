    <h3> Data Project </h3>
    <p> As part of my Computer Science course, I had to do a data project.  The problem I addressed was if mint 
      actually cools things down.  Many commercials for mints say that thier mints have a "cooling effect", and I wanted
      to find out if that is true.  So, I did an expirament with three types of mints: Lifesavers Wint O Green, Mentos, and
      Myntz! (vanilla).  I dissolved each one in hot water and recorded the temperature of each glass every five
      minutes.  I then placed the data into a chart and a graph, as seen below. </p>
