  <h2> WELCOME!</h2>
  <p> Welcome to this website!  It was created for a school project.  If you are not part of this course,
   you will most likely find this very boring.  You can find a lot of different things on this site, such as
   more projects, information, and HTML stuff. (Lists! Images! Fun!)  Use the navigation bar to explore the site. </p>
